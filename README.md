# phx-lv-feed
A small real-time chat/feed application built with **Phoenix LiveView**, **Phoenix.Presence**, **ETS**, and **GenServers** — no database required.  This project demonstrates how to build a clean, production-style LiveView app using OTP primitives and Phoenix’s real-time tooling instead of a traditional persistence layer.
